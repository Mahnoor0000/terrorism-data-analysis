# Terrorism Data Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes a global terrorism dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to terrorist incidents worldwide. The analysis focuses on the **frequency of attacks, casualties, attack categories, perpetrators, and regional distribution**.  

The aim is to demonstrate the use of **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

##  Analysis Performed  

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted dates to datetime format  
   - Created new features (`Year`,  `CASUALTIES = DEAD + INJURED`)  

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Total incidents per country & region  
   - Casualty distribution across years  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Deaths by attack category  
   - Perpetrator vs number of incidents  

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Scatterplot of DEAD vs INJURED by category

##  Key Insights  
- Terrorism is **highly concentrated** in a few regions (South Asia, Middle East).  
- **Explosions** are the deadliest category of attack, followed by assaults.  
- A few groups are responsible for a disproportionately large number of attacks.  
- Certain years show sharp spikes in incidents and casualties, aligning with major conflicts.
